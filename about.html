            <p>
                It was the early 80’s. A time when the term “ICT” was something new to Sri Lankan mind. A group of courageous Anandians stepped up together and formed the “Ananda College Computer Society”. With the advent of time, this society became a pioneer in the school computing arena. Time Passed. By the start of the 21st century, the society was nearly abandoned until a group of skillful Anandians with determination took the initiative on reviving the society back to its glory days.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like a Phoenix border-top-right-radiussing from the ashes, the society was reborn as the Ananda College Information and Communication Technology Society. Completely rejuvenated; the society started its journey to accomplish the goal of revolutionizing the school-based ICT of Sri Lanka.
